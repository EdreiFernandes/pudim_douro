## What's Pudim D'Ouro?

Pudim Douro is a familiar tradition. It's a competition that occurs every new year. The objective is to create the best dessert for the New Year's party.
This tradition arose after a Christmas party where there was just one dessert, a terrible Pudim. That pudim gives the competition name.
